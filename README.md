## Motivation
I always wanted to make a mobile game, but I always struggled with the idea of "doing a big game" that "would be a massive success".
This took me to a dark path of starting a lot of projects but never finishing them.
So instead, I decided to make a simplier game to learn the about the engine and game development itself, and I'm truly happy with the results, even though the game is not the most fun, it accomplish it's objective.

## The game
You control a ball that has to dodge the cannon bullets.
As the time passes, the difficult increases. While your ball grows, the cannons start to shoot faster.

For now the game don't have powerups... yet.
You can collect coins but they don't do anything just yet.
I'm developing them and plan to release in a few weeks. This will certainly make the game more fun.

If you would like to play this alpha version of CannonDodge, you can download it from the play store:
